# Welcome

## Description

This is a fullstack app made just with NextJS

In this project I created an ecommerce example app with signin and signup features, edit and delete users and a fake checkout to be improved later

This app fetches an fake api store to retreive products and add to a fake cart

The backend, with create, read, update and delete user features are under the ./src/app/api path

## Setup

First, you have to install node dependencies, open your terminal, go to this folder and run:

`npm install`
ou
`yarn install`

Second, now you can run the project by running the following commands on terminal:

`npm run build`
`npm start`
ou
`yarn build`
`yarn start`

Third, now access http://localhost:3000/ and be happy
